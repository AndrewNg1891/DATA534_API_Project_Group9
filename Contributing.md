## Git Workflow Practices

All team members agree to the Feature Branch workflow, and the following conventions (master branch protection):
1. When each member starts building on a new feature, they will create their new branch with relevant name apart from main branch.
2. Any time a member would like to add, commit, and push their code. They should do that for the local and remote of the feature branch first.
3. After the remote feature branch had been pushed successfully, the member should send a pull request for merging their updated feature to the main branch (if it was approved by other groupâ€™s members.)
4. When conflicts happened during merging, the team member should attempt checking their work to solve within their reasonable time first. If it could not be resolved, they should seek for help from other members on time to avoid any delays.

## Are you interested to contribute to our project?

Our package is used to help users to check login activities in certain API such as GitHub as well as serving  higher level purposes such as analysis, for example, helping users allocate appropriate resources for maintenance. Recognizing that for the community, your contributions to us are very important.
If you would like to contribute to a project and make it better, your help is very welcome. Contributing is also a great way to learn more. Please feel free to send us a good, clean pull request, we highly appreciate it. Please note that we use R language, so please follow [tidyverse style guidelines](https://style.tidyverse.org/).

### How to make a clean pull request

- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on! Branch from `develop` if it exists, else from `master`.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
- Write or adapt tests as needed.
- Add or change the documentation as needed.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `develop` branch if there is one, else go for `master`!
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).

### You have a big thanks from our team!
